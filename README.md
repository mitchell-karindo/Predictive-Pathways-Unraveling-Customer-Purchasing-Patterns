# ðŸ§  Predictive Pathways: Unraveling Customer Purchasing Patterns

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to **analyze and predict customer purchasing behavior** using machine learning.  
By uncovering hidden patterns in customer transaction data, the model helps businesses **understand purchasing pathways** and **anticipate future buying behavior**, enabling better decision-making and targeted marketing strategies.

This end-to-end project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and insights visualization.
